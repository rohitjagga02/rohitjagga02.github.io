I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm pursuing a dual-degree in Computer Science &amp; Economics from [Penn Engineering](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) and [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/). I have engaged in significant tutoring and research work since high school, and I am particularly interested in projects dealing with machine learning, fintech, and social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

I am a Teaching Assistant (TA) for [CIS545: Big Data Analytics](https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/cis545), a graduate-level class on applying fundamental data science &amp; machine learning techniques at the scale of massive, real-world datasets. Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning Research Intern at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia ([CHOP](https://www.chop.edu/)), and as a Software Engineering Intern at [OffWeGo](https://www.offwego.io/), a student-centric risk management startup.
